## Cloud Computing

* [kubernetes/kops](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops) A tool to deploy high availability k8s cluster on cloud platform (AWS, GCE...)
  Powerful feature.

* [coreos/kube-aws](https://github.com/coreos/kube-aws) A deployment tool for k8s handled by CoreOS.
  Comment: Refer to [issue #157 Why does kube-aws suck so much? ](https://github.com/coreos/kube-aws/issues/157). It took me a lot of time
  to configure the dns for k8s. It would be better if they provide video tutorial.

* [WHY DATABASES ARE NOT FOR CONTAINERS](https://myopsblog.wordpress.com/2017/02/06/why-databases-is-not-for-containers/)
  Managing stateful containers (db in container) makes production and testing environment more complicated. It losses the feature of stateless and faces
  the limitation of container virtualization (network and I/O).
